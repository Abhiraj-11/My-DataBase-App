# Database App with CRUD Operations - React

Welcome to my Database Web App with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations built using React! This application allows you to interact with a database and perform basic CRUD operations to manage your data effectively.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server with the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Features

1. **Create**: Add new records to the database. Enter the required information in the provided form and click the "Add" button to create a new entry.

2. **Read**: View the existing records in the database. The application will display the data in a table format for easy visualization.

3. **Update**: Modify existing records. Click on the "Edit" button in the respective row to update the information. The application will open a form with the existing data pre-filled for editing.

4. **Delete**: Remove unwanted records from the database. Click on the "Delete" button in the respective row to delete the entry.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing and navigation within the application.
- **Axios**: To perform HTTP requests to interact with the backend and manage CRUD operations.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsiveness to ensure an intuitive user interface.

## Backend Integration

This version of the Database Web App focuses on the frontend implementation using React. For CRUD operations to work effectively, you need to have a backend server that handles the actual data storage and retrieval.

Ensure you have a functional backend that supports the necessary endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. This backend should be capable of responding to HTTP requests made by the frontend application using Axios or any other HTTP client library.
